# Hot Eject
## Overview
Hot Eject is a Utility software that allows user to assign hotkeys (e.g Ctrl + Alt + Z) for use in safely ejecting USB drives. It was inspired by the majority of windows users I see clicking on Ctrl + Alt in an attempt to safely eject a USB (that doesn't work out-of-the-box people, use this) . This is me trying to help.
