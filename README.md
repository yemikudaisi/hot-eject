# SRU (short for safely remove USB)
## Overview
SRU Utility software that allows user to assign hotkeys (e.g Ctrl + Alt + Z) for use in safely removing USB drives. It was inspired by the majority of people I see around clicking on Ctrl + Alt when attempting to remove USB. I sincerely don't know where the got idea came from. This is me trying to help.

## System Requirements (running SRU)
 - Windows Vista or higher.
 - [.NET 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30653)
 
 ## Todos
 - Show locking process when file in USB is being used.
 - Configurable hot key (globally and for each drive..not sure how to go about it yet) for (uses Ctrl + Alt + Z for now).
 - Confgure autorun app on device added or removed (handy for backup and sync tools)
 - Add command line support
 - Reconnect a device without removing and re-adding
 - Implement options UI
 - Think of more todos.
